# Mod Loader Installers

Automatically install mod loaders like Forge, Fabric without requiring users to manually install them.

## Automatic Mod Loader Installation

* Forge: [Installer.Forge](../../installer.forge/README.md)
* Fabric: [Fabric Installer](fabric-installer.md)
* Quilt: [Quilt Installer](quilt-installer.md)
* LiteLoader: [LiteLoader Installer](liteloader-installer.md)

## Third-party Libraries

Thanks to community contributions, there are installers that can be used with CmlLib.Core. These libraries are not official projects managed by CmlLib.

* Optifine: [https://github.com/mzggr0914/Optifine.Installer](https://github.com/mzggr0914/Optifine.Installer)

## Direct Mod Loader Extraction

If the mod loader you want to install is not in the above list or if there are unsupported versions, you can extract files directly and install them.

See [Mod Loader File Extraction](extract-files.md)

Distribute the extracted files with your launcher. A commonly used method is to upload extracted files to your own file server, and have the launcher download files from the server and copy them to the appropriate path.
