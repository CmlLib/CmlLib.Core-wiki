# MForge

`MForge` is wrapper of Forge installer.

```csharp
var forge = new MForge(launcher);

// add event handlers
forge.FileChanged += fileChanged;
forge.ProgressChanged += progressChanged;
forge.InstallerOutput += (s, e) => Console.WriteLine(e);

// install the best forge version
await forge.Install("1.20.1");

// install the specific forge version
await forge.Install("1.20.1", "47.1.0");

// install without checking
await forge.Install("1.20.1", forceUpdate: true);
await forge.Install("1.20.1", "47.1.0", forceUpdate: true);
```

## Event Handlers

For `FileChanged` and `ProgressChanged`, see [Event Handling](../cmllib.core/getting-started/Handling-Events.md).

With `InstallerOutput`, you can get logs from the forge installer. For example:  

```
Forge installer 
```

## Install Methods

### Install(string mcVersion, bool forceUpdate = false)

Install the best Forge version for the given `mcVersion`. The best Forge version is determined by following rule:

1. Recommended version
2. Latest version
3. First version

### Install(string mcVersion, string forgeVersion, bool forceUpdate = false)

Install the specific Forge version.

### forceUpdate: true

Installer checks if the Forge version is already installed and skip installation if exists. However with `forceUpdate: true` option, The installer does not skip installation and always install and overwrite existing version.
