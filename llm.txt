you have a mission: read all markdown files in /ko and fix errors.

- remove unnecessary tooltips ("mention")
- convert HTML to markdown
- convert {% hint %} to Admonitions. we use python markdown extension. (??? or !!!)
- fix small typo
- escape > as \> but do not escape inside of codeblock or URL, and do not escape <
- if hyperlink has no title, reference mkdocs.ko.yml to find its title. for example, replace [login-and-sessions](../login-and-sessions/README.md) to [로그인과 세션](../login-and-sessions/README.md)
- DO NOT insert \ or <br> for linebreak. if you find any legal linebreaks, replace it with double space.
- DO NOT change the content of documents
- if you find broken link or ambigious, let me know before working

there are so many files that you may forgot which file is done and which file is not proceed yet.
use `llm-checklist.txt` file as a checklist. process only unchecked files and skip checked files. mark 'check' after you've done each file.

there are so many files in /ko so you may prefer write an regex script or something instead of reading every files.
